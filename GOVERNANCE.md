# OpenMemory Governance Model

_Last updated: 2025-10-18_

---

## 1. Overview

**OpenMemory** is an open-source, community-driven project under the umbrella of **Spectrum Labs**.  
This document defines how decisions are made, who has authority within the project, and how contributors can grow into maintainers.

Our goal is to ensure transparency, trust, and long-term sustainability for all contributors and users.

---

## 2. Guiding Principles

1. **Openness** — All major discussions, decisions, and changes happen publicly.  
2. **Meritocracy** — Influence is earned through consistent, meaningful contributions.  
3. **Accountability** — Maintainers act in the project’s best interest, not personal gain.  
4. **Empowerment** — Contributors are encouraged to take initiative and propose improvements.  
5. **Neutrality** — OpenMemory remains vendor-neutral and framework-agnostic.

---

## 3. Roles and Responsibilities

| Role | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Contributor** | Anyone who submits code, documentation, or feedback through issues or pull requests. |
| **Reviewer** | Contributors with a proven track record who review pull requests for correctness, clarity, and quality. |
| **Maintainer** | Trusted developers with merge rights and responsibility for a major subsystem (e.g., backend, JS SDK, or embeddings). |
| **Lead Maintainer / Core Team** | Oversees project vision, approves roadmap changes, and manages releases. |
| **Advisor (optional)** | Experienced external contributors providing technical or strategic input. |

---

## 4. Decision Process

- **Minor changes** (typos, bugfixes): can be merged by any maintainer after one approval.
- **Moderate changes** (new APIs, refactors): require two maintainers’ approval.
- **Major proposals** (architecture redesign, deprecation, rebrand): discussed via a **Request for Comment (RFC)** issue and voted on by the core team.

Each maintainer has one vote.  
A proposal passes with **majority approval (≥60%)**.

---

## 5. Project Structure

OpenMemory is divided into modular components:

| Module | Lead | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `backend/` | Core Team | memory engine |
| `sdk-js/` | JS Maintainer | JavaScript SDK for web and Node |
| `sdk-py/` | Python Maintainer | Python SDK for researchers and AI devs |
| `docs/` | Documentation Lead | Guides, diagrams, and developer docs |
| `examples/` | Community | Reference implementations and agent demos |

Each module may evolve independently as long as compatibility with the API contracts is maintained.

---

## 6. Roadmap and Releases

- The roadmap is maintained publicly in `/docs/roadmap.md`.  
- Minor releases every **3–4 weeks**.  
- Major releases every **3–6 months**.  
- Every release must:
  - Update `CHANGELOG.md`
  - Pass automated CI/CD checks
  - Be signed off by two maintainers

---

## 7. Conflict Resolution

If disagreements arise:
1. Seek consensus via respectful discussion.  
2. If unresolved, escalate to core maintainers for mediation.  
3. Persistent issues may be put to a formal vote by the core team.  

Maintainers must act in good faith and prioritize project health.

---

## 8. Adding New Maintainers

To become a maintainer:
1. Be an active contributor for at least **3 months**.  
2. Have at least **3+ approved PRs** merged.  
3. Be nominated by an existing maintainer.  
4. Be confirmed by majority vote.

Inactive maintainers (>90 days no activity) may be transitioned to **emeritus status**.

---

## 9. Amendments

This governance document may be amended through a pull request approved by **two-thirds of the core maintainers**.
