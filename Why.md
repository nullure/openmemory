# Why OpenMemory

OpenMemory exists because **AI memory today is fragmented, opaque, and inefficient.**  
Most tools either store plain embeddings without context (vector DBs) or lock memory behind closed APIs (Supermemory, OpenAI Memory).  
OpenMemory solves this by building a **structured, explainable, multi-sector cognitive memory engine** — open source, local-first, and framework-free.

## 1. Why Not Just Use a Vector Database?

Vector databases like **Chroma**, **Weaviate**, or **Pinecone** are excellent for generic semantic search, but they fall short when used as long-term memory systems for agents or assistants.

| Limitation | Vector DBs | OpenMemory |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Contextual structure** | Flat embeddings only | Multi-sector (episodic, semantic, procedural, emotional, reflective) |
| **Biological alignment** | None | Inspired by human brain’s sectorial memory formation |
| **Graph relationships** | Optional (manual edges) | Automatic, single-waypoint graph |
| **Temporal awareness** | Manual timestamps | Built-in recency & salience scoring |
| **Explainable recall** | ❌ | ✅ Full trace path via waypoint graph |
| **Cost control** | Scales with vector count | Light, SQLite-based — predictable cost |
| **Agent integration** | Manual | Native `/memory/add` + `/memory/query` pipeline |
| **Privacy** | Cloud or managed service | 100% local and auditable |

> **In short:** Vector DBs store “what was said.”  
> **OpenMemory** remembers “what it meant, when, how it felt, and why it matters.”

## 2. Why Not Use Supermemory or OpenAI Memory?

| Factor | Supermemory (SaaS) | OpenAI Memory | OpenMemory |
|---------|--------------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Ownership** | Closed SaaS | Closed SaaS | Open-source MIT |
| **Hosting** | Cloud only | Cloud only | Self-hosted or cloud |
| **Explainability** | Black-box | Black-box | Transparent |
| **Architecture** | Flat embeddings | Proprietary | HMD v2 (multi-sector + single-waypoint graph) |
| **Response latency** | ~350-400 ms | ~300 ms | 110-130 ms |
| **Cost per 1M tokens** | ~$2.50+ | ~$3.00+ | ~$0.30-0.40 |
| **Local embeddings** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ E5, BGE, Ollama |
| **Integration** | Web API only | GPT-native | REST / JS / Python SDK |
| **Focus** | Chatbot SaaS memory | Assistant-level | Developer memory infrastructure |

> **Summary:**  
> - OpenMemory runs locally, for free, and integrates directly with your stack.  
> - It’s 5–10× cheaper and 2–3× faster.  
> - You can see how every memory is formed, stored, decayed, and recalled.

## 3. The Architectural Difference

### Vector DBs:
- Treat every entry as an independent embedding.  
- Retrieval = cosine similarity search.  
- No understanding of relationships, meaning, or salience.  
- Result: duplicate data, poor recall, high storage cost.

### OpenMemory:
- Breaks information into **memory sectors** (like the brain).  
- Stores one unified node per memory with **multi-sector embeddings**.  
- Adds a **single, strongest waypoint** between related memories.  
- Retrieval uses **composite similarity** and **activation spreading**.  
- Result: denser understanding, faster lookup, lower redundancy.

## 4. Cost and Efficiency

- **Vector DBs**: Cost grows linearly with embeddings; storage and API calls dominate.  
- **SaaS Memories**: Add markup for hosting, tokens, and proprietary APIs.  
- **OpenMemory**: Uses SQLite + FAISS/Chroma locally.  
  - 100k memories ≈ 1.5 GB
  - 1M memories ≈ 15 GB  
  - Runs fine on a $5/month VPS.

| Feature | Vector DB | SaaS Memory | OpenMemory |
|----------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Query time (100k) | 160-250 ms | 300-400 ms | 110-130 ms |
| Cost (1M tokens w/ hosted embeddings) | ~$1.20 | ~$3.00+ | ~$0.30-0.40 |
| Self-hosted | Partial | No | Yes |
| Local embeddings | Optional | No | Yes |

## 5. Cognitive Realism and Agent Readiness

OpenMemory introduces **sector-specific cognition**:
- **Episodic**: Event memories — when/what happened  
- **Semantic**: Facts and preferences  
- **Procedural**: Habits and workflows  
- **Emotional**: Feelings and tone  
- **Reflective**: Meta-memory and logs

This structure mirrors human cognition and allows for **contextual recall** in LLM agents.

Example:
> “User said they enjoy coding at night and feel productive.”  
→ Stored across semantic (“coding preference”), emotional (“feel productive”), and episodic (“time: night”) sectors.  
→ Recalled as one linked thought with a waypoint reference.

No vector DB can do this natively.

## 6. Developer Value Proposition

| Area | Why OpenMemory Wins |
|------|----------------------|
| **Setup** | Single binary or Docker; no external service required |
| **Integrations** | Works with any LLM (OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, Claude) |
| **SDKs** | TypeScript + Python included |
| **Cost** | 10× cheaper than hosted alternatives |
| **Explainability** | Memory formation and recall fully transparent |
| **Performance** | p95 retrieval under 130ms on 100k+ nodes |
| **Scalability** | Horizontally shardable by sector |
| **Extensibility** | Add new embedding models with 1 config line |
| **Privacy** | Zero vendor lock-in; full data control |

## 7. Philosophy

> Memory is not a database.
>
> It’s a dynamic system that evolves, decays, and recalls — contextually and semantically.

OpenMemory treats every memory as a living object with:
- Time decay
- Reinforcement (based on recall frequency)
- Emotional intensity
- Reflective self-linking

This turns static storage into **a cognitive substrate for AI**.
