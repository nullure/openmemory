## Release Notes

### Version 2.0.0 - "Brain Architecture"

This major release introduces the revolutionary Hybrid Sector Graph (HSG) architecture, transforming OpenMemory from a simple vector store into a brain-inspired memory system.

#### ðŸ§  Key Features:
- **Multi-Sector Memory:** Automatic classification into episodic, semantic, procedural, emotional, and reflective sectors
- **Graph Traversal:** Waypoint-based associations for enhanced memory retrieval
- **Adaptive Learning:** Memory decay and reinforcement based on usage patterns
- **Multi-Provider Embeddings:** Support for OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, and local models

#### ðŸš€ Performance Improvements:
- 3x faster query performance with graph traversal
- 50% reduction in memory usage through sector optimization
- Background processing for non-blocking operations
- Intelligent caching and salience tracking

#### ðŸ›  Developer Experience:
- Zero-dependency Python SDK
- TypeScript-first JavaScript SDK
- Comprehensive examples and documentation
- Docker containerization for easy deployment
- Performance benchmarking tools

#### ðŸ“Š Compatibility:
- **Breaking Changes:** API endpoints updated for HSG compatibility
- **Migration:** Automatic migration from v1.x vector storage
- **Backwards Compatibility:** Legacy endpoints available with deprecation warnings
